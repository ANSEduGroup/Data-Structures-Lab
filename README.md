# Data Structures and C
---

The below definition describes data structures using C beautifully and is an extract from the book **"Data Structures using C and C++** by **Yedidyah Langsam, Moshe J. Augenstein, Aaron M. Tenenbaum**

*"A C programmer can think of the C language as defining a new machine with its own capabilities, data types, and operations. The use rcan state a problem solution in terms of the more useful C constructs rather than in terms of lower-level machine-language constructs. Then, problems can be solved more easily because a larger set of tools is available.
The study of data structure therefore involves two complementary goals. The first goal is to identify and develop useful mathematical entities and operations and to determine what classes of problems can be solved by using the entities and operations. The second goal is to determine representation for those abstract entities and to implement the abstract operations on these concrete representations. The first of these goals views a high-level data type as a tool that can be used to solve other problems, and the second views the implementation of such a data type as a problem to be solved using already existing data types. In determining representations for abstract entities, we must be careful to specify what facilities are available for constructing such representations. For example, it must be stated whether the full C language is available or whether we are restricted to the hardware facilities of a particular machine."*

The only prerequisite before learning data structure or surfing through the repository is at least one semester long course in Programming, and some basic knowledge in C. The programs here uses elementary C and nothing extraordinary.
